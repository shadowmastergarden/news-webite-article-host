        "explanation":  "The chainsaw was originally developed in Scotland in the late 18th century, around 1780, by doctors John Aitken and James Jeffray. It wasn\u0027t built for cutting wood, but for a gruesome medical procedure called symphysiotomy. Before complications in childbirth could be resolved by modern C-sections, doctors sometimes had to widen the pelvic bone to allow the baby to pass. This tool, which resembled a small chain with serrated teeth driven by a hand crank, was designed to cut through the cartilage and bone of the pelvis more quickly and accurately than a knife or saw. It wasn\u0027t until the early 20th century that the technology was scaled up.",

        "explanation":  "The human stomach is an incredibly hostile environment, filled with hydrochloric acid and powerful enzymes like pepsin designed to break down tough food proteins. This acid is strong enough to dissolve metal like razor blades. To survive its own digestive juices, the stomach wall is lined with a protective layer of mucus and epithelial cells. However, this layer is constantly expanding and being damaged by the acid. As a defense mechanism, the stomach completely regenerates this inner lining roughly every three to four days.",

        "explanation":  "Wombats are the only known species in the animal kingdom to produce cube-shaped feces. This unique capability serves a practical evolutionary purpose: wombats are territorial and use their scat to mark their boundaries. Since they often live on sloped territories with rocks and logs, round droppings would easily roll away. The cubic shape allows the poop to stay exactly where it is placed, effectively stacking up like bricks. Scientists found that this shape is formed in the last section of the wombatâ€™s intestine.",

It is predominantly herbivorous, feeding on the protein-rich buds of acacia plants. While it can eat ants or larvae, over 90% of its diet comes from plant matter, making it a unique anomaly in the arachnid world.",

        "explanation":  "Have you ever bobbed for apples? The reason this game works is that apples are buoyant. If you drop an apple into a bucket of water, it won\u0027t sink. This is because roughly 25% of an apple\u0027s volume is made up of air pockets trapped between its cells. This relatively high air content makes the apple less dense than water, allowing it to float on the surface.",
